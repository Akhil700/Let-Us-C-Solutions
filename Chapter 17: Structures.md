# [Chapter 17: Structures] Solutions  

## [A] 
      
       (a) 1004 1008 1058
       (b)
             CrankShaft 102133
             CrankShaft 102133
             CrankShaft 102133
      (c) 2 If you are driven by success make sure that it is a quality drive
  
## [B]
 
      (a)age cannot be used without any object reference.
      (b) book is not any structure name. 
            b do not belong to any structure.
      (c) variable v in printf statement, should have some index,
      as it is an array of strcuture.
      (d)
       1. In f() function, structure is passed by value, so "." operator
       should be used.
      2. In g() function, structure is passed by its address, so "->"
      operator should be used.
      (e)   NO ERROR

## [C]
      
      (a) Array
      (b) 1 & 2 are true.
