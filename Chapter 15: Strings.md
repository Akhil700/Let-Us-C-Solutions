## [B]
 
    (a) 

    Error: As the str3 is declared but not defined, so it is only
    void pointer, so without allocating memory to it, we cannot
    store anything to it.
    (b) No Error
    (c) Error: In arr++ statement. As you can see that arr[8] is initilized
        at the time of declaration. So in that case we cannot assign anything 
        to arr, and statement arr++ is execute as arr = arr + 1, which is 
illegal.
